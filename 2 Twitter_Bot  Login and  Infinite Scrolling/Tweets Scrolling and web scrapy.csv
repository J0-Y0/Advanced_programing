@TwitterSupport,"We had big hopes for Fleets, but now it’s time to say goodbye and take flight with other ideas. Starting August 3, Fleets will no longer be available. More on what we learned and what's coming (1/4)"
@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"
@TwitterSupport,We learned a lot from Fleets and we’re excited to focus on newer and better ways to start conversations on Twitter. We’re proud of the work so far and have no plans of slowing down. (3/4)
@TwitterSupport,"Taking big chances helps us make the best product possible for you, but it doesn't always work out like we planned. It’s not always easy to say goodbye to a feature like Fleets, but we’re excited to get back to work on what we’ve got planned next: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets.html… (4/4)"
@sebparkinson,And an edit button but only once you do the above
@ladyofacat,"Please let us have multiple gifs per tweet I’m begging on my knees. It would be such a popular feature, everyone would love it especially me"
@ClipseNuka,I love using gifs in my posts and I can just imagine the possibilities of using 2 gifs at once. I'm guessing they wont do it though
@krysxpp2,"Hi @TwitterSupport i've been following @krysxpp for long time, this user has never done anything to violate twitter rules. It's suspended w/no email notice. Could u please consider&unsuspend it? She appealed the restriction via case no. #0215097024 bt still no response, TIA."
@BackupKy1e,"Hi @TwitterSupport , I filed a DMCA counter-notification over 10 days ago and never got a notice. This means that my account (@Ky1eWRLD) should have been unsuspended. However, it is still locked. Please unlock my account because it is now in good standing. Case # 0203668923"
@fluffykittensox,I’m impressed that you have actually taken note of what didn’t work and also listened to the populace. Thank you for that it’s appreciated.
@TwitterSupport,
@NickTurner13,"How about getting rid of racists, where's that on your list of priorities?"
@dumbledong,Hey @twittersupport my business account (580k) was suspended due to false copyright claims @ellebrookeuk . I successfully appealed all claims and was told after 10 business days my account would be reinstated. I still haven’t obtained any response. Please help #0211860185
@ThomBartley,"Please don’t pull a @mosseri and hit us with a “we’re not longer a short message sharing app”. Insta lost its way because all it does is steal other people’s ideas (Stories = worked, push towards video / shopping doesn’t) Hope you come up with something original / good"
@nhfabioo,Something is not working on my twitter account! I can't see the most engaged tweets when I click on the TOP section. Instead it shows the most recent ones! Help me!
@FranDerry,Same same!
@mcclure111,"Okay but let us remove the fleets bar, it sounds like you're just going to leave a list of ""spaces"" there and I don't want to see a list of ""spaces"" either"
@Erick_O_Mokua,"That is a sober,great http://move.How about giving us a character limit of say 250 per tweet instead of somebody doing so many tweets explaining a topical issue?It will be a great move I believe."
@Erick_O_Mokua,"I also want to vouch for the ""Edit"" option feature but the original message will not be deletable but ""If"" one deletes the original message under any edit,then the whole ""Thread"" will simply get deleted."
@CatholicJosh122,An edit button. Now. Signed - LITERALLY. EVERYONE
@MibIH,So maybe now you'll give us the Edit button every Twitter user has been crying out for since day one?
@Chicks126,"To make it ""the best product possible"" add an ""EDIT"" icon. And just accept that people are going to use the word ""fuck"" in their tweets."

@nbranche,Interesting. I hope @Twitter doesn’t kill off voice tweets before I get to try it…that feature launched before fleets and I never got around to fleeting
